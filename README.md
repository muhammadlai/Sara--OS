> Turn any B2B export business into an AI-powered sales machine in 5 minutes.

> ✅ **New · 2026-06-07** — **Template v3.8.0**: GitHub Actions CI for `npm test`, post-deploy `deploy/doctor.sh` health checks, configurable remote OpenClaw paths for non-root deployments, and expanded validation for skill counts + workspace path generation. [See full changelog →](./CHANGELOG.md)

> 🚀 **New · 2026-06-12** — **OpenClaw v2026.6.6**: Security hardening across 10+ vectors (exec approvals fail-closed, deleted-agent ACP bypasses closed), Telegram account-scoped topic routing, iMessage always-on inbound restart, WhatsApp successor-controller fix, Claude Fable 5 adaptive thinking support, and faster UI startup via cached model metadata. [See full changelog →](./CHANGELOG.md)

> 📦 **Add-on · 2026-05-22** — **[WhatsApp Legacy Account Onboarding Spec v0.5](./whatsapp-old-account-onboarding/docs/README.md)** *(Path D — Multi-Device fetch)*: Lowest-friction history acquisition — customer scans one QR, waits for Multi-Device sync, `bootstrap.sh` pulls .txt files straight from the connected account. No backup, no password, no USB. Backup-extraction (v0.4) still default for zero-downtime tenants. Three-layer architecture (MemOS + sales_playbook + conversation_history), A/B/C/D delivery decision tree, strict auto-onboard gate.

An open-source, production-ready template for building AI Sales Development Representatives (SDRs) that handle the **full sales pipeline** — from lead capture to deal closing — across WhatsApp, Telegram, and email.

Built on [OpenClaw](https://openclaw.dev), battle-tested with real B2B export companies.

```

Each layer is a Markdown file you customize for your business. The AI reads all layers on every conversation, giving it deep context about your company, products, and sales strategy.

## Quick Start

### Option A: One-Line Installer

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/muhammadlai/Sara--OS/main/install.sh | bash
```

The installer checks prerequisites, installs [OpenClaw](https://openclaw.dev), clones this repository, and walks you through configuration.

> Publishing AITZAZ AI 2070 as an installable ClawHub skill is planned for a future phase.

### Option B: Full Deployment (5 Minutes)

#### 1. Clone & Configure

```bash
git clone https://github.com/muhammadlai/Sara--OS.git
cd Sara--OS

# Edit the 7 workspace files for your business
vim workspace/IDENTITY.md   # Company info, role, pipeline
vim workspace/USER.md       # Your products, ICP, competitors
vim workspace/SOUL.md       # AI personality and rules
```

#### 2. Set Up Deployment Config

```bash
cd deploy
cp config.sh.example config.sh
vim config.sh               # Fill in: server IP, API key, WhatsApp number
```

#### 3. Validate Locally

```bash
cd ..
npm test
```

This checks the template structure, shell scripts, product KB JSON, proforma invoice generation, Chroma memory smoke flow, and generated OpenClaw config before you touch a server.

#### 4. Deploy

```bash
cd deploy
./deploy.sh my-company

# Output:
# ✅ Deploy Complete: my-company
# Gateway:  ws://your-server:18789
# WhatsApp: Enabled
# ChromaDB Memory: Enabled (chromadb + local chroma-memory)
# Skills:   b2b_trade (41 skills)
```

#### 5. Verify Remote Health

```bash
./doctor.sh
```

Doctor checks SSH, Node/npm, OpenClaw CLI, `openclaw.json` permissions, workspace context files, local skills, Gateway service state, Gateway `/health`, and Chroma memory.

That's it. Your AI SDR is live on WhatsApp and ready to sell.

## What It Does

### Full-Pipeline Sales Automation (10 Stages)

| Stage | What the AI Does |
|-------|------------------|
| **1. Lead Capture** | Auto-detect inbound messages (WhatsApp/Telegram/CTWA ads), create CRM records |
| **2. BANT Qualification** | Natural conversation to assess Budget, Authority, Need, Timeline |
| **3. CRM Entry** | Structured data capture — name, company, country, ICP score, product interest |
| **4. Research & Enrichment** | Jina AI web search + company website analysis, 3-layer enrichment pipeline |
| **5. Quotation** | Auto-generate PDF quotes, multi-language, send to owner for approval |
| **6. Negotiation** | Track counter-offers, recommend strategy, escalate when needed |
| **7. Reporting** | Daily 09:00 pipeline reports, 15:00 stalled alerts, weekly summaries |
| **8. Nurture** | Automated follow-ups, industry news, post-sale care, quarterly check-ins |
| **9. Email Outreach** | Personalized cold email sequences (Day 1/3/7/14), auto follow-up |
| **10. Multi-Channel Orchestration** | Cross-channel coordination (WhatsApp + Email + Telegram), auto-switching |

### Automated Scheduling (14 Pipeline Checks)

| Schedule | Task |
|----------|------|
| Every heartbeat | New lead intake, quote tracking, meeting prep, and data-quality checks |
| Every 30 min | Gmail inbox scan for client replies |
| Daily 09:00 | Pipeline report to owner via WhatsApp |
| Daily 10:00 | AI lead discovery (market rotation: Africa/ME/SEA/LatAm) |
| Daily 11:00 | Email follow-up sequence check |
| Daily 15:00 | Stalled lead detection |
| Weekly Wed | Nurture campaign |
| Weekly Fri | Competitor intelligence gathering |
| Weekly Mon | Weekly summary report |
| Daily 12:00 | CRM snapshot to ChromaDB (L4 disaster recovery) |
| Daily 14:00 | Memory health check (Supermemory + ChromaDB stats) |
| Every heartbeat | Microsoft Teams mention/DM scan for sales handoff |
| Every 30 min | WhatsApp 72h window expiry check → auto-switch to Telegram |

### Human-Like Conversations
- Responds in the customer's language (auto-detected)
- Natural message pacing with delivery-queue skill (3-90s delays, message splitting)
- Timezone-aware sending (7 market timezone mappings)
- Cultural adaptation (Middle East, Africa, SEA, LatAm, Europe)
- Never reveals AI identity — presents as your sales consultant

### Dynamic ICP Scoring
- Initial score based on 5 weighted dimensions (purchase volume, product match, region, payment ability, authority)
- **Auto-adjusts** based on interaction: fast reply +1, asks for quote +2, mentions competitor +2, 7d no reply -1
- Hot leads (ICP>=7) auto-flagged, owner notified immediately

### 4-Layer Anti-Amnesia System

AI agents lose context in long conversations and across sessions. Our **4-layer anti-amnesia architecture** ensures your AI SDR never forgets:

```
Message In ──→ L1 MemOS auto-recall (structured memory injection)
    │
    ├──→ L3 ChromaDB per-turn store (customer-isolated, auto-tagged)
    │
    ├──→ L2 Proactive Summary at 65% tokens (haiku compression, zero info loss)
    │
    └──→ L4 CRM Snapshot daily 12:00 (disaster recovery fallback)
```

| Layer | Engine | What It Does |
|-------|--------|-------------|
| **L1: MemOS** | Structured memory | Auto-extracts BANT, commitments, objections every turn. Injects into System Prompt at conversation start. |
| **L2: Proactive Summary** | Token monitoring | Compresses at 65% context usage via haiku-class model. All numbers, quotes, commitments preserved verbatim. |
| **L3: ChromaDB** | Per-turn vector store | Every conversation turn stored with `customer_id` isolation. Auto-tags quotes, commitments, objections. Semantic retrieval across sessions. |
| **L4: CRM Snapshot** | Daily backup | Stores full pipeline state daily to ChromaDB as disaster recovery. If any layer fails, L4 has the data. |

**Result**: Your AI SDR remembers every customer, every quote, every commitment — even after 100+ turns, weeks of silence, or system restarts.

### Skill Profiles

Choose a pre-configured skill set based on your needs:

| Profile | Skills | Best For |
|---------|--------|----------|
| `b2b_trade` | 41 skills | B2B export companies (default) |
| `lite` | 16 skills | Getting started, low-volume |
| `social` | 14 skills | Social media-focused sales |
| `full` | 40+ skills | Everything enabled |

## Industry Examples

Ready-to-use configurations for common B2B export verticals:

| Industry | Directory | Highlights |
|----------|-----------|------------|
| **Heavy Vehicles** | `examples/heavy-vehicles/` | Trucks, machinery, fleet sales, African/ME markets |
| **Consumer Electronics** | `examples/electronics/` | OEM/ODM, Amazon sellers, sample-driven sales |
| **Textiles & Garments** | `examples/textiles/` | Sustainable fabrics, GOTS certified, EU/US markets |

To use an example, copy it into your workspace:

```bash
cp examples/heavy-vehicles/IDENTITY.md workspace/IDENTITY.md
cp examples/heavy-vehicles/USER.md workspace/USER.md
# Then customize for your specific business
```

## Product Knowledge Base

Structure your product catalog so the AI can generate accurate quotes:

```
product-kb/
├── catalog.json                    # Product catalog with specs, MOQ, lead times
├── products/
│   └── example-product/info.json   # Detailed product info
└── scripts/
    └── generate-pi.js              # Proforma invoice generator
```

## Control Dashboard

After deployment, your AI SDR comes with a built-in web dashboard:

```
http://YOUR_SERVER_IP:18789/?token=YOUR_GATEWAY_TOKEN
```

The dashboard shows:
- Real-time bot status and WhatsApp connection
- Message history and conversation threads
- Cron job execution status
- Channel health monitoring

The token is auto-generated during deployment and printed in the output. Keep it private — anyone with the URL+token has full access.

> **Security note**: Set `GATEWAY_BIND="loopback"` in config.sh to disable remote dashboard access. Default is `"lan"` (accessible from network).

## WhatsApp Configuration

By default, the AI SDR accepts messages from **all WhatsApp contacts** (`dmPolicy: "open"`). This is the recommended setting for sales agents — you want every potential customer to be able to reach you.

| Setting | Value | Meaning |
|---------|-------|---------|
| `WHATSAPP_DM_POLICY` | `"open"` (default) | Accept DMs from anyone |
| | `"allowlist"` | Only accept from `ADMIN_PHONES` |
| | `"pairing"` | Require pairing code first |
| `WHATSAPP_GROUP_POLICY` | `"allowlist"` (default) | Only respond in whitelisted groups |

To change after deployment, edit `~/.openclaw/openclaw.json` on the server:

```json
{
  "channels": {
    "whatsapp": {
      "dmPolicy": "open",
      "allowFrom": ["*"]
    }
  }
}
```

Then restart: `systemctl --user restart openclaw-gateway`

## Deployment

### Prerequisites
- A Linux server (Ubuntu 20.04+ recommended)
- Node.js 18+
- An AI model API key (OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, Kimi, etc.)
- WhatsApp Business account (optional but recommended)

### Configuration

All configuration lives in `deploy/config.sh`. Key sections:

```bash
# Server
SERVER_HOST="your-server-ip"

# AI Model
PRIMARY_API_KEY="sk-..."

# Channels
WHATSAPP_ENABLED=true
TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN="..."

# CRM
SHEETS_SPREADSHEET_ID="your-google-sheets-id"

# Admin (who can manage the AI)
ADMIN_PHONES="+1234567890"
```

For non-root servers or custom OpenClaw locations, set the remote paths instead of editing deploy scripts:

```bash
SERVER_USER="openclaw"
REMOTE_HOME="/srv/openclaw"
REMOTE_OPENCLAW_HOME="/srv/openclaw/.openclaw"
REMOTE_CONFIG_HOME="/srv/openclaw/.config"
REMOTE_WORKSPACE_DIR="/srv/openclaw/.openclaw/workspace"
```

CI runs `npm test` on every push and pull request to `main`.

### WhatsApp IP Isolation (Multi-Tenant)

When running multiple agents on the same server, each should have a unique exit IP so WhatsApp sees independent devices. This prevents cross-account flagging.

```bash
# After deploying a client, isolate their WhatsApp IP:
./deploy/ip-isolate.sh acme-corp

# Or with a specific SOCKS5 port:
./deploy/ip-isolate.sh acme-corp 40010
```

**How it works:**

```
                  ┌─ wireproxy :40001 → WARP Account A → CF IP-A
                  │    ↑
tenant-a ─────────┘    ALL_PROXY=socks5://host:40001

tenant-b ─────────┐    ALL_PROXY=socks5://host:40002
                  │    ↓
                  └─ wireproxy :40002 → WARP Account B → CF IP-B
```

Each tenant gets:
- A dedicated free [Cloudflare WARP](https://1.1.1.1/) account
- An isolated [wireproxy](https://github.com/pufferffish/wireproxy) instance (~4MB RAM)
- A unique Cloudflare exit IP for all outbound traffic (including WhatsApp)

To auto-enable during deploy, set `IP_ISOLATE=true` in `config.sh`.

### AITZAZ AI 2070 Dashboard

The repository ships with a futuristic AI-OS control dashboard (`dashboard/`). It renders live data generated from the real project files (workspace layers, skills, product KB, validation results) — no mock data. Sections for capabilities that do not exist yet are explicitly marked as future phases.

```bash
npm run dashboard   # regenerate dashboard/data.json from the actual project files
open dashboard/index.html   # or serve it with any static file server
```
